              The Talent Identification Program has been designed to unearth our next generation of Queensland sporting stars. The aim is to develop and nurture young Queensland athletes who have the potential to be an Olympian in 2032.
              <br />
              <br />
              Athletic ability is the key ingredient in the program. You may be currently competing in a sport that isn’t in the Olympics, but we may identity an Olympic sport that’s perfect for your athletic strengths.
